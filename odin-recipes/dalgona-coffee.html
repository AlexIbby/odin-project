    <!-- Ingredients -->
            <h2 class="recipe-header"> Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li class="recipe-paragraph">2 tbsp. granulated sugar</li>
                    <li class="recipe-paragraph">2 tbsp. instant coffee</li>
                    <li class="recipe-paragraph">2 tbsp. cold water</li>

    <!-- Steps -->
        <h2 class="recipe-header"> Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li class="recipe-paragraph">In a medium bowl, combine sugar, coffee, and water. Using a hand mixer or a whisk, vigorously whisk until mixture turns silky smooth and shiny, then continue whisking until it thickens and holds its lofty, foamy shape. (If whisking by hand, it will take 8 to 12 minutes to get to optimal fluffiness.)</li>
        <li class="recipe-paragraph">Fill a glass most of the way full with ice and milk, then dollop and swirl the whipped coffee mixture on top, mixing before drinking, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
