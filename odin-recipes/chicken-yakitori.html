        <h2 class="recipe-header"> Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li class="recipe-paragraph">In a medium-size pot whisk together soy sauce, water, mirin, rice vinegar, sugar, ginger, garlic, and cornstarch.</li>
        <li class="recipe-paragraph">Bring mixture to a boil, constantly whisk until sauce is slightly thickened, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li class="recipe-paragraph">Transfer 1 cup of the sauce to a bowl to use for basting the chicken.</li>
        <li class="recipe-paragraph">Thread cut pieces of chicken on wooden skewers that have been soaked in water for 30 minutes. Season with salt and pepper on both sides.</li>
        <li class="recipe-paragraph">Drizzle both sides of skewers with a small amount of oil to prevent sticking when cooking.</li>
        <li class="recipe-paragraph">Preheat grill over medium-high heat. Use a paper towel dipped in oil to clean and grease the grill grates.</li>
        <li class="recipe-paragraph">Once the grill is hot add the skewers and cook for 4 minutes. Flip over and baste the cooked side with the sauce. Cook 4 minutes.</li>
        <li class="recipe-paragraph">Flip skewer over, baste with sauce, cook 2 minutes covered.</li>
        <li class="recipe-paragraph">Flip skewer over again, baste, cook 2 minutes covered.</li>
        <li class="recipe-paragraph">Repeat flipping, basting and covered cooking 2 additional times, 16 minutes total cooking time.</li>
        <li class="recipe-paragraph">Sprinkle chicken yakitori skewers with sesame seeds. Serve immediately with additional sauce.</li>
